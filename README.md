# metricks

Metricks is a free reaction metric calculator for synthetic chemical reactions. Currently, it can calculate Process Mass Intensity (PMI), E-Factor, Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME), and Effective Mass Yield (EMY) values from the same set of data.

## Getting Started

Input the names and masses of your reagents and product. Please make sure that you are using the same mass units for all of your reagents and your product. For accurate Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME) and Effective Mass Yield (EMY) calculations, please mark whether the reagent is a reactant (involved in the equation A + B + C -> D/is consumed), and/or whether it is benign.

If you need to add rows to the Reagent Table, please use the "Add reagent" action link.
